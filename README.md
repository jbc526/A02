In order to use GitHub inside of the README.md file, you first need to create a GitHub account where you will create a new repository.

<strong>GitHub<strong> is an online platform where users will have the opportunity to store, share, and collaborate on code. If your document is lost or serious bugs are introduced, GitHub will allow you to to revert to the previous version. 

GitHub uses <strong>Git<strong> which is a version control system that allows you to track differences and changes made in files which are uploaded to or downloaded from GitHub for storage and collaboration. 

To create a GitHub account, visit the website https://github.com to sign up for GitHub using your email address and creating your own password! 

Once you have your new GitHub account, click the plus sign icon on the top right corner of the page and click "New Repository". This is where you will enter a repository name, add a description of your new repository (optional), and either set your repository as "Public" or "Private". Lastly, checkmark the "Add a README file" under "Initialize this repository with:" and click Create Repositiory at the bottom of the page. 

To install Git on your desktop, it will depend on the operating system of your desktop whether it is Linux, MacOS, or Windows, as the process of installing git will be different. Visit the website https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git and follow the instructions based off of your specific operating system. 

For any operating systems, in order to verify if you have successfully installed git, you can open the command line terminal and type in <i>git --version</i>. 

Next, you can, of choice, either download Webstorm at https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ or Visual Studio Code at https://code.visualstudio.com/download .
I use Visual Studio Code, which is an IDE where developers can write, test, and debug code. If you do decide to use Visual Studio Code, download from the link above. Once you have it installed, open the software and it will lead you to a welcome page.
